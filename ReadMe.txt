For the Medical Diagnosis task solution consists of two parts; Backend and Frontend 


The backend development of the solution was designed and developed using  the following tools and technologies.
- Java programming language
- JDK 1.8
- eclipse enterprise
- SpringBoot framework
- Maven - to manage project dependecies & to automate build process
- postman for testing api's
- dependecies- The dependecies include json, unirest , springboot dependecies and should be in the pom.xml of the src of the project

The frontend development of the solution was designed and developed using simple html and JavaScript.Unfortunately I couldnt finish the whole 
frontend process due to time contraints but I manage to design the functionality to display the symptoms,issues and display the diagnosis& issues once the user clicks submit. 

  - To run the application double click on the start.bat file 
  - You should be seeing a black screen/ cmd
  - Once you see the log "Started Application" then
  - open index.html with any browser of yours choice.
  
To test api's that I have implemented to atlest appreciate the effort on the backed you can use postman.
I have included the collection tests in the solution.
-import Medical Diagnosis.postman_collection.json to postman any version

To access the src project 
- import the file in eclipse - >Maven -> existing maven project -> navigate to the MedicalDiagnosis folder-> finish

Note: The application uses port 8000 which is set in the application.properties file  


Thank you.
